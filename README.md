# Fuzzy-Charger

A project that was developed as a postgraduate assignment for the master's degree in Software Development and Artificial Intelligence in the subject "Fuzzy Software Systems Technology".

The project was implemented in python and as a development tool Visual Studio Code was chosen. The purpose was to create a fuzzy electric car charging management software system. </br> </br>

<b>Ιnstallation Ιnstructions:</b> </br> </br>

1. Download the project.
2. Open the project with Visual Studio Code.
3. So to run the program it is necessary to have Python and Tkinter, Matpotlib, Datetime, Numpy, Scikit-Fuzzy libraries installed.
4. Run it and explore all its functions. </br> </br>
